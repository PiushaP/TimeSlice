# TimeSlice
TimeSlice is a personalized study and break time management tool that suggests optimal study durations and engaging activities based on user preferences and age ranges. 
This was my first time doing HTML,CSS, and Javascript to build a project like this. I am unsure if there are any more files I have to submit. There are many other features I wanted to implement from better design to a timer and hope to do in the future.
